"Opportunities pass like a cloud." Imam Ali PBUH

I have made this application for personal task and time managing.

**its best feature is that it can prioritize your tasks.**


## How it prioritize
There are three concepts I should explain:
1. principals
2. frameworks
3. importance
### principals:
They are the morals of your life, the things you always keep and the things you never do. They are what set you apart from others.
They are like four things or more, but you know, they are few because they are so general.
> here is some examples: don't be a bottleneck, work for good of society, give happiness to friends, battle with enemies.
### frameworks:
they are the actual things you do. the things that hold you in your principals.
the things that make you closer to your goals.
>examples: have a job, read books, create fun contents, donate.
### importance:
well its actualy my method of telling importance of a task.
there is two way to describe importance of a task:
1. how much it is repeated: (every day, once compulsive, once normal)
2. how fast it should be done. (very fast: compulsive, normal, it varies)
so if we put them togheter we have 9 variations, and in the order of high importance to low it will be like this:

    speed       repeate
1.  Compulsive  Compulsive
2.  Compulsive  Daily
3.  Compulsive  Normal
4.  Normal      Compulsive
5.  Variable    Compulsive
6.  Normal      Daily
7.  Variable    Daily
8.  Normal      Normal
9.  Variable    Normal

## Task Form
and all the above explanations creates this Form in which user will select his principles and frameworks and importance wich is related to this task.

## Doctrine Form
its the form which user will add his principals and order them.

## Frame Form
its the form which user will add his frameworks and order them.

## Form1
its the main form and shows a calendar and a view for the tasks.

user selects a date in calendar and in the view below, the tasks will render.

the menus in this form allows user to:
1. go to task form
2. go to doctrine form
3. go to frame form
4. go to web sync form
5. go to link account form (for cloud server)
6. change the view from daily to weekly
7. change the theme

## prioritized view
in main form (Form1) the user may select the view to show the tasks in priority.
this view will show a number on the tasks from 0 for the highest priority task to higher numbers for lower tasks.
and it has a gradient from black to red to white from high to low tasks.

## the current indicator
there is a red line renderd in current time on the views.
